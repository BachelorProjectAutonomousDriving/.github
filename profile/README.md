**Welcome to the Bachelor Project Autonomous Driving (BPAD)! This GitHub Organization contains all the tools and information you will need to get started.**

# For students

Good to have you here! Currently we are busy setting everything up for you to get started. We are opening up participant applications from **February 2024** and will get started **April 2024** so make sure to keep an eye on the project. If you have any questions, please reach out to *email@address.vu.nl* (will be updated to a real email soon).

# For supervisors and contributors

We have compiled a [knowledge base]() with everything we think you should know. It covers all the important topics (software and hardware design, communication protocols, code style guides, the repository management setup) and serves as the entrypoint to understanding and contributing to the BPAD project.
